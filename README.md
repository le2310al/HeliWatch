# HELIWATCH

This project consists of a Docker container that queries ADSB APIs for information on aircrafts within a specified radius
of a point of interest. Information on the nearest aircraft is published via a local HTTP server which can then be read
by Rainmeter so that you can display any information of interest on your Rainmeter dashboard.

Hardware (optional):
Display (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007464814035.html)
Power Cable (https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BR9Q4HDT?th=1)
HDMI Cable (https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07GGL79FL)
RTL-SDR* (https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005952566458.html)
Antenna Upgrade (https://thepihut.com/products/60cm-1090mhz-antenna-for-ads-b)

Software (optional)
Ultrafeeder (https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-adsb-ultrafeeder)

As this project relies on the ADSB.fi API, I recommend that you become a 'feeder' by setting up an RTL-SDR receiver and 
running Ultrafeeder. As an added bonus you will be able to query their API every 30 seconds instead of every 60 seconds
and distance of the aircraft relative to your (antenna's) position will be more accurate.
If you are a feeder you do not necessarily have to rely on the API, as you can use your own readsb data generated by Ultrafeeder.
However, as multiple antennas are required to receive MLAT signals, you will likely need to configure 'beast_in' in Ultrafeeder 
or stick with the API if you are interested in MLAT aircrafts.

Since I am mainly interested in helicopters and would like to know why they hover over my house as well as who owns them,
I used the dist API endpoint of ADSB.fi and used the procured hex to query Hexdb API for the Owners. I filtered out Helicopters
by their Type code  as shown in /ICAO and additionally display their SQUAWK as shown in /SQUAWK.
example results:
Gama Aviation - Air Ambulance Helicopter Emergency Medivac
National Police Air Service - Police Air Support



ASDB.fi API endpoints:
/v2/hex/[hex]
/v2/icao/[hex]
/v2/callsign/[callsign]
/v2/registration/[reg]
/v2/sqk/[squawk]
/v2/mil
/v2/lat/[lat]/lon/[lon]/dist/[dist]
