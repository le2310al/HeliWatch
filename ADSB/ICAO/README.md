# ICAO

This script reads the Type Designators provided by the FAA 
(https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/orders_notices/index.cfm/go/document.current/documentNumber/7360.1)
into CSV files separated by class (landplane, amphibian, seaplane, gyroplane, helicopter, powered_lift).
As the document provides further information on FAA Weight Class, ICAO WTC, CWT, SRS and LAHSO the script can be 
customised to filter by these characteristics.
